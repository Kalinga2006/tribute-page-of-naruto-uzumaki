                <br>
                Shunned by the world, orphaned and feared for something he never chose, Naruto began life in the shadows. But even in his loneliest moments, he refused to let the darkness consume him. Beneath the pranks and loud laughter was a child screaming to be seen — not with pity, but with respect. His pain became fuel, and his dream of becoming Hokage was born not from ambition, but from a desperate, unyielding hope to matter.

            <br>
            <p><b>Stage - Teenage years</b>
            <br>
            As a teen, Naruto transformed pain into power. He trained relentlessly, endured loss, and went to the ends of the earth to bring his friend Sasuke back — not because he had to, but because he wouldn’t give up on anyone, even those who gave up on themselves. His strength wasn't just in jutsu, but in his soul — a fire that refused to die, a loyalty so fierce it changed enemies into allies.

            <h4>3. The Warrior of Peace Who Carried the World
            </h4>
            <br>
            <p><b>Stage - Adulthood</b>
            <br>
            From the boy who wonce alone, Naruto rose to become the Seventh Hokageas  — the protector of the village that once rejected him. Wielding power that rivaled gods, he chose compassion over conquest, and unity over fear. He became a symbol not just of strength, but of healing — a man who carried the pain of the past, the hope of the future, and the will of fire in his heart.
